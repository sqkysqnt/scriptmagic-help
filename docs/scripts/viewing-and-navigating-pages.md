# Viewing & Navigating Pages

The script view displays your script one page at a time, with tools for navigation and zoom.

## Page navigation

- **Previous / Next buttons** — step through pages one at a time using the arrow buttons
- **Page number input** — type a page number and press Enter to jump directly to that page
- **Roman numerals** — for front matter pages before "Page 1" (set via the page offset), you can enter Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc.)
- **Page counter** — shows your current position (e.g., "5 / 120")

The next few pages are preloaded in the background so navigation feels smooth.

## Zooming

Use the zoom controls to adjust the view:

- **Zoom in / out buttons** — step by 25% increments
- **Preset levels** — choose from 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, or 200% via the dropdown
- **Zoom range** — from 50% up to 500%

The page stays centered as you zoom.

## Scrolling

Pages are displayed vertically. Scroll down to move through the page content. To advance to the next page, use the navigation buttons or enter a page number.

# Script Variants

Variants let you create alternative page orderings of your script without re-uploading the PDF. This is useful for managing different versions of a script — for example, a stage manager's prompt book vs. a director's cut.

## What is a variant?

A variant is a named sequence of pages. Every production starts with a **Default** variant containing all pages from the uploaded PDF in order. You can create additional variants with different page selections and orderings.

## Creating a variant

1. Open the variants manager from the production edit screen
2. Click **New**
3. Enter a name for the variant
4. Add pages from existing PDFs, upload a new PDF, or insert blank pages

## Managing pages in a variant

### Reorder pages

Drag and drop pages within the variant grid to rearrange them.

### Add pages

- **From a new PDF** — upload an additional PDF to add its pages to the variant
- **Blank pages** — insert blank pages at any position

### Select and move pages

- Click to select individual pages, or select multiple pages with checkboxes
- **Cut / Copy / Paste** — move or duplicate selected pages
- **Delete** — remove selected pages from the variant (the underlying page files are not deleted)

### Duplicate a variant

Creates a copy of the variant with a new name. All page references are duplicated, but the actual pages are shared.

### Set as default

Mark a variant as the one that loads when the production is opened.

### Delete a variant

Removes the variant and its page ordering. The underlying page files are not deleted.

## How variants relate to annotations

Annotations (highlights, cues, notes, tags, blocking) are attached to **pages**, not variants. If the same page appears in two variants, it shows the same annotations in both.

This means you can reorganize pages across variants without losing any annotation work.

# Character Stickers

Character stickers are the visual markers you place on the blocking canvas to represent where characters are positioned on stage.

## Sticker appearance

Each character's sticker is customizable in the [Characters](../productions/characters.md) management screen:

- **Shape** — Circle (default), square, triangle, or headshot (uses the actor's photo)
- **Fill color** — The sticker's background color
- **Border color** — The sticker's outline color
- **Text** — Initials or a custom abbreviation displayed on the sticker

All stickers are the same size on the canvas for visual consistency.

## Placing a sticker

1. Open the **Characters tab** in the blocking editor's right sidebar
2. Long-press and drag a character name from the list
3. Drop it onto the canvas at the desired position

The sticker appears immediately and the action can be undone.

## Moving a sticker

Long-press and drag any sticker on the canvas to reposition it. The sticker follows your cursor and snaps to the canvas area. Changes are tracked in the undo history and auto-saved when you release.

## Removing a sticker

Drag a sticker from the canvas back onto the **Characters tab** in the sidebar and drop it. The character returns to the available list and can be placed again later. This action can be undone.

## Layers

Stickers are assigned to the currently active blocking layer. Use the **Layers tab** in the sidebar to:

- Switch between layers
- Show or hide layers (toggle the eye icon)
- Add new layers for organizing different blocking configurations (e.g., "Opening positions" vs. "After crossover")

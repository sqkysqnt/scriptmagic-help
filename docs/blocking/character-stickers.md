# Character Stickers

Character stickers are the visual markers you place on the [blocking canvas](the-blocking-editor.md) to represent where characters are positioned on stage.

## Sticker appearance

Each character's sticker is customizable in the [Characters](../productions/characters.md#sticker-appearance) management screen:

- **Shape** — Circle (default), square, triangle, or headshot (uses the actor's photo)
- **Fill color** — The sticker's background color
- **Border color** — The sticker's outline color
- **Text** — Initials or a custom abbreviation displayed on the sticker

All stickers are the same size on the canvas for visual consistency.

## Placing a sticker

1. Open the **Characters tab** in the blocking editor's right sidebar
2. Long-press and drag a character name from the list
3. Drop it onto the canvas at the desired position

The sticker appears immediately and the action can be undone.

## Moving a sticker

Long-press and drag any sticker on the canvas to reposition it. The sticker follows your cursor and snaps to the canvas area. Alignment guides appear automatically to help you line up with other elements. Changes are tracked in the undo history and auto-saved when you release.

## Selecting and multi-selecting

- **Single select** — Tap a sticker to select it. The [Properties panel](the-blocking-editor.md#sidebar-right) shows details for the selected element.
- **Multi-select** — Hold shift and tap additional stickers to add them to the selection.

## Grouping characters

When 2 or more character stickers are selected, a **Group** button appears in the toolbar and the Properties panel. See [Character Groups](the-blocking-editor.md#character-groups) for details on how groups work.

## Locking and z-order

From the Properties panel, you can:

- **Lock** a sticker in place to prevent accidental moves
- **Change z-order** to control which elements appear in front of or behind others

## Removing a sticker

Drag a sticker from the canvas back onto the **Characters tab** in the sidebar and drop it. The character returns to the available list and can be placed again later. This action can be undone.

## Layers

Stickers are assigned to the currently active blocking layer. Use the **Layers tab** in the sidebar to:

- Switch between layers
- Show or hide layers (toggle the eye icon)
- Add new layers for organizing different blocking configurations (e.g., "Opening positions" vs. "After crossover")

!!! tip
    Use multiple blocking layers to show different moments within the same scene — for example, where characters start vs. where they end up after a cross.

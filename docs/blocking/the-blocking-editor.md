# The Blocking Editor

The blocking editor is a full-screen visual tool for creating stage diagrams that show where characters are positioned during a scene. These diagrams — called blocking maps — can be linked to specific pages, scenes, or songs in your production.

## Opening the editor

From the script view, open the **Blocking panel** and click **New** to create a new blocking map, or click **Open in Editor** on an existing one.

## Editor layout

The blocking editor is divided into three areas:

### Canvas (center)

The main workspace where you place and arrange character stickers. If you've added a background image (like a stage layout or set design), it appears here.

### Metadata bar (top)

- **Title** — A name for this blocking map (e.g., "Act 1, Scene 2 — Opening positions")
- **Page number** — Links the blocking map to a specific script page
- **Linked structure item** — Connect this blocking to an act, scene, or song from your [production structure](../productions/production-structure.md)
- **Short description** — A one-line summary
- **Detailed notes** — Multi-line notes and instructions

### Sidebar (right)

Three tabs:

- **Characters** — Lists all characters in your production. Drag characters from here onto the canvas.
- **Set Pieces** — Reserved for future functionality.
- **Layers** — Manage blocking layers. Each layer can hold its own set of stickers, and layers can be shown or hidden independently.

## Background images

You can add a stage layout or set design image as the canvas background:

1. Click the **Pick Background** button in the toolbar
2. Select an image file from your device
3. Use **Edit Background Transform** to adjust the image — move, scale, rotate, or crop it to fit your needs
4. Use **Reset Background Transform** to return to the default position

## Toolbar actions

- **Save** — Force an immediate save (changes also auto-save after a short delay)
- **Undo / Redo** — Step backward or forward through your changes
- **Pick Background** — Upload a background image
- **Clear All Blocking** — Remove all stickers from the canvas
- **Edit Background Transform** — Adjust the background image position, scale, rotation, and crop
- **Reset Background Transform** — Reset the background to its default state

## Auto-save

Changes are automatically saved shortly after you stop making edits. A "Saving..." indicator appears in the toolbar while a save is in progress.

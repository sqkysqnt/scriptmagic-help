# Joining a Production

Once you have a ScriptMagic account, there are a few ways to get added to a production.

## Via invitation link

This is the most common path. A production admin or team lead sends you an invitation email containing a link.

1. Click the link in the email
2. If you're **not signed in**, you'll see the invitation landing page with a sign-up or sign-in option
3. If you're **already signed in** with the matching email, the production is added to your account automatically
4. You'll be redirected to your productions dashboard with the new production listed

!!! warning
    Invitation links expire after **7 days**. If you see an "invitation expired" message, ask the person who invited you to resend it.

## Added directly by an admin

A production admin can add you directly from the People management screen if you already have a ScriptMagic account. In this case:

- You don't need to click any link
- The production will appear on your dashboard the next time you load the app
- You may receive a welcome email depending on the production's settings

## What happens when you join

When you join a production, you're assigned a role that determines what you can see and do:

- **Cast** — View scripts and your own annotations
- **Production Team** — View and edit shared annotations, cues, and layers
- **Production Admin** — Full access to manage people, characters, structure, and production settings

Your role can be changed later by a production admin. See [Roles & Permissions](../collaboration/roles-and-permissions.md) for details on what each role can do.

## Viewing your productions

After joining, go to your **productions dashboard** to see all productions you have access to. Each production card shows:

- Production name and company
- Venue
- Opening date (with countdown)
- Cover image

Click a production to open its script view.

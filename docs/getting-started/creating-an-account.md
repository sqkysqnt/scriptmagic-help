# Creating an Account

There are two ways to get a ScriptMagic account: through an invitation link or by requesting access.

## Joining via invitation (recommended)

The most common way to get started is through an invitation from your production team.

1. You'll receive an email with a link to join a specific production
2. Click the link — you'll see the invitation details (who invited you, which production, and your assigned role)
3. Fill in the sign-up form:
    - **Email** — pre-filled from the invitation (read-only)
    - **Full name** — pre-filled if provided by the person who invited you
    - **Phone number** (optional)
    - **Password** — minimum 6 characters
    - **Confirm password**
4. Click **Create Account & Join**
5. You'll be signed in and taken to your productions dashboard

!!! note
    Invitation links expire after **7 days**. If your link has expired, ask your production team to send a new one.

If you already have a ScriptMagic account and receive an invitation to a new production, just sign in — the production will be added to your dashboard automatically.

## Requesting access

If you don't have an invitation link, you can request an account from the login screen.

1. Go to the ScriptMagic login page
2. Click **Create Account**
3. Fill in the request form:
    - **Email** (required)
    - **Full name** (required)
    - **Phone number** (required)
    - **Pronouns** (optional)
    - **Role/Position** (optional)
    - **Emergency contact** (optional)
    - **Notes** (optional)
4. Submit your request

Your request will be reviewed by a production admin. If approved, you'll receive an email with instructions to complete your account setup.

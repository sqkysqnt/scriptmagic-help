# What is ScriptMagic?

ScriptMagic is a collaborative platform for script markup, rehearsal planning, and show preparation. It gives production teams a shared digital workspace to annotate scripts with performance notes, blocking directions, cues, and staging information.

## Who is it for?

ScriptMagic is built for anyone involved in putting on a show:

- **Stage managers** tracking cues, blocking, and rehearsal notes
- **Directors** marking blocking positions and scene notes
- **Designers** (lighting, sound, video) placing cue markers on scripts
- **Production teams** coordinating across departments
- **Cast members** viewing their scripts and personal notes

## What can you do with it?

- **Upload and view scripts** as PDFs, with page navigation and zoom
- **Annotate scripts** with highlights, text notes, cues, and tags
- **Create blocking maps** showing character positions on stage
- **Organize with layers** so each department or individual can have their own annotation space
- **Manage productions** including people, characters, and show structure (acts, scenes, songs)
- **Export annotated scripts** as PDFs with your chosen layers and annotations included
- **Collaborate in real time** with your team — changes sync across all devices

## Where does it run?

ScriptMagic works on the web, iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux. Your data syncs across all devices, so you can prep at your desk and reference your script in the booth.

## Key concepts

Before diving in, here are a few terms you'll see throughout ScriptMagic:

- **Production** — A show or project. Everything (scripts, people, annotations) lives inside a production.
- **Layer** — An organizational container for annotations. Layers control who can see and edit specific annotations.
- **Variant** — An alternative page ordering of your script. Useful for different versions (e.g., a director's cut vs. the full script).
- **Blocking map** — A visual diagram showing where characters are positioned on stage.
- **Cue** — A two-part annotation linking a moment in the script to a cue description (e.g., "LX 42 GO").

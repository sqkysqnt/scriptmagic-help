# Navigating the App

ScriptMagic is organized around two main screens: the **productions dashboard** and the **script view**.

## Productions dashboard

This is your home screen after signing in. It lists all the productions you have access to.

Each production is shown as a card with:

- Cover image (or a placeholder)
- Production name
- Company name
- Venue
- Opening date with a countdown (e.g., "Opens in 5 days")
- An **Edit** button if you have permission to manage the production

Click any production card to open it in the script view.

## Script view

The script view is where you'll spend most of your time. This is the main workspace for reading, annotating, and collaborating on a script.

Key areas of the script view:

- **Script pages** — The central area displays your script pages one at a time. Scroll vertically to move through the script.
- **Page navigation** — Previous/Next buttons and a page number input let you jump to any page. Supports Roman numerals for front matter (i, ii, iii).
- **Zoom controls** — Zoom in and out with preset levels (50% to 200%) or step controls.
- **Layers panel** — Manage your annotation layers. Toggle visibility, create new layers, and switch your active editing layer.
- **Cue list panel** — View all cues across your cue layers in a sortable, filterable list.
- **Blocking panel** — Access blocking maps and open the blocking editor.
- **Music, video, and blocking tags** — Media tags appear on script pages where they've been placed.

## Account menu

The account menu is available in the top-right corner of most screens. From here you can:

- **Edit Profile** — Update your name, phone, pronouns, address, emergency contact, and profile photo
- **Submit Feedback** — Send feedback to the ScriptMagic team
- **About ScriptMagic** — View app version and information
- **Admin Dashboard** — Access administrative tools (visible to admins only)
- **Log Out** — Sign out of your account

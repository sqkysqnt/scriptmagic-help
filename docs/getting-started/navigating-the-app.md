# Navigating the App

ScriptMagic is organized around two main screens: the **productions dashboard** and the **script view**. Here's how to find your way around.

## Productions dashboard

This is your home screen after signing in. It lists all the productions you have access to.

Each production is shown as a card with:

- Cover image (or a placeholder)
- Production name
- Company name
- Venue
- Opening date with a countdown (e.g., "Opens in 5 days")
- An **Edit** button if you have permission to manage the production
- **Download for offline** buttons (see [Offline mode](#offline-mode))

Click any production card to open it in the script view.

!!! tip
    Productions are sorted by opening date, with upcoming shows listed first. Once a show has opened, a celebration banner appears on its card.

## Script view

The script view is where you'll spend most of your time. This is the main workspace for reading, annotating, and collaborating on a script.

Key areas of the script view:

- **Script pages** — The central area displays your script pages. Scroll vertically to move through the page content, and use navigation controls to move between pages.
- **Page navigation** — Previous/Next buttons and a page number input let you jump to any page. Supports Roman numerals for front matter (i, ii, iii). See [Viewing & Navigating Pages](../scripts/viewing-and-navigating-pages.md).
- **Zoom controls** — Zoom in and out with preset levels (50% to 200%) or step controls. The zoom range goes up to 500%.
- **Layers panel** — Manage your annotation [layers](../annotations/understanding-layers.md). Toggle visibility, create new layers, and switch your active editing layer.
- **Outline panel** — Browse your [production structure](../productions/production-structure.md) hierarchy (acts, scenes, songs) with page links and built-in duration timers. See [Outline panel](#outline-panel).
- **Cue list panel** — View all [cues](../annotations/cues.md) across your cue layers in a sortable, filterable list.
- **Blocking panel** — Access [blocking maps](../blocking/the-blocking-editor.md) and open the blocking editor.
- **Music panel** — Manage [music tags](../annotations/tags.md#music-tags) and audio files.
- **Video panel** — Manage [video tags](../annotations/tags.md#video-tags) and video links.
- **Music, video, and blocking tags** — [Media tags](../annotations/tags.md) appear on script pages where they've been placed.
- **Help search** — Search the help documentation from within the app for quick answers.

## Outline panel

The outline panel displays your production's structure as a navigable tree — acts, scenes, songs, intermissions, and transitions. From here you can:

- **Jump to a page** — Click any structure item's page number to navigate directly to that point in the script
- **Start a timer** — Click the stopwatch icon on any structure item to start a duration timer. Multiple timers can run simultaneously, useful for timing scenes or transitions during rehearsals.
- **View hierarchy** — See the full structure of your show at a glance, with scenes nested inside acts and songs nested inside scenes

!!! tip
    The outline panel is especially useful during rehearsals for quickly navigating to specific scenes and timing them in real time.

## Offline mode

ScriptMagic supports downloading productions for offline use. From the productions dashboard:

1. Click the download button on a production card
2. Choose which components to download:
    - **Script pages** — the page images for viewing offline
    - **Annotations** — your highlights, notes, and cues
3. The download progress is shown in real time
4. Once downloaded, the production is available without an internet connection

Changes made offline are queued and synced automatically when you reconnect.

## Account menu

The account menu is available in the top-right corner of most screens. From here you can:

- **Edit Profile** — Update your name, phone, pronouns, address, emergency contact, and profile photo. See [Profile Settings](../account/profile-settings.md).
- **Help** — Search the help documentation for answers to your questions
- **Submit Feedback** — Send feedback to the ScriptMagic team
- **About ScriptMagic** — View app version and information
- **Legal** — View terms, privacy policy, and legal information
- **Admin Dashboard** — Access administrative tools (visible to admins only)
- **Log Out** — Sign out of your account

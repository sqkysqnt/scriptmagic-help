# Characters

Characters in ScriptMagic represent the roles in your production. They're used for casting assignments, scene tracking, and blocking maps.

## Creating characters

### Add manually

1. Open the Characters management screen
2. Click **Add Character**
3. Enter the character name
4. Fill in additional details as needed

### Import a list

1. Click **Import Characters**
2. Paste a list of character names (one per line)
3. Characters are created with default settings, and duplicates are skipped

## Character properties

Each character has:

- **Name** — the character or role name (e.g., "Elphaba")
- **Custom name / group label** (optional) — for ensemble roles like "Ballet Girls" or "Town Ensemble"
- **Assigned people** — one or more cast members. Ensemble roles can have multiple people assigned.
- **Scenes and songs** — which scenes and musical numbers the character appears in

## Sticker appearance

Every character has a customizable sticker used in [blocking maps](../blocking/the-blocking-editor.md). You can configure:

- **Shape** — circle (default), square, triangle, or headshot (uses the actor's photo)
- **Fill color** — the sticker's background color
- **Border color** — the sticker's outline color
- **Text** — initials or a custom abbreviation (auto-derived from the character name if left blank)

Click the sticker preview on a character to open the sticker editor and customize these settings.

## Assigning people to characters

1. Select a character
2. Open the **People** section
3. A dialog shows all production members — check or uncheck to assign or remove
4. Filter by name or email to find specific people

Multiple people can be assigned to a single character for ensemble roles. When you assign a character to a person, it also appears on their record in the People management screen.

## Assigning scenes and songs

1. Select a character
2. Click **Select scenes...** or **Select songs...**
3. Check the scenes or musical numbers the character appears in
4. Filter by name to find specific items

If a character is assigned to a song that's nested inside a scene, the parent scene is automatically shown as inherited.

## Deleting characters

Select a character and click the trash button. The character will be unassigned from all people and removed from the production.

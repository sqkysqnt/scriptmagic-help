# Creating & Managing Productions

A production is the top-level container in ScriptMagic. It holds your script, people, characters, structure, annotations, and blocking — everything related to a single show.

## Creating a production

To create a new production, you'll need **Production Admin** or **Company Admin** permissions.

1. From the productions dashboard, click **Create Production**
2. Fill in the production details:

**Core information:**

- **Production name** (required)
- **Description** (optional)
- **Theatre company** (required) — select which company this production belongs to
- **Venue** (optional)
- **Rights holder information** (optional) — for documenting licensing and contracts

**Dates:**

- **Production start date** — when rehearsals or production work begins
- **Opening date** — the official opening performance
- **Freeze date** — the deadline after which script and blocking changes are locked

**Script & media:**

- **Script PDF** — upload your master script (see [Uploading a Script](../scripts/uploading-a-script.md))
- **Production image** — a poster or cover image for the production card
- **Pages before script page 1** — set an offset if your PDF contains cover pages or front matter before the actual script begins

**External resources:**

- **External links** — add URLs to external resources like Google Drive folders, chorus tracks, or reference videos. Each link has a label and URL.

3. Click **Save** to create the production

## Editing a production

Click the **Edit** button on a production card (visible if you have edit permissions). From here you can update any of the fields above, including:

- Replacing the script PDF
- Changing the production image
- Updating dates and external links
- Managing who the production is shared with

!!! warning
    Replacing the script PDF may break existing annotations, blocking, and page references. You'll see a confirmation warning before this change is applied.

## Deleting a production

Productions can be permanently deleted from the edit screen. This removes the production and all associated files. This action cannot be undone.

## Production dashboard

Your productions dashboard shows all productions you have access to. Each card displays:

- Production image
- Name and company
- Venue
- Opening date with a countdown (e.g., "Opens in 5 days")
- A celebration banner once the show has opened

Productions are sorted by opening date, with upcoming shows listed first.

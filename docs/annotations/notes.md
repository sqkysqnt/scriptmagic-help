# Notes

Notes are text-based annotations you can place anywhere on a script page. They're useful for adding instructions, reminders, or observations directly on the script — like writing in the margins of a paper script, but digital.

## Adding a note

1. Select your active [layer](understanding-layers.md)
2. Create a highlight on the script page
3. Double-click the highlight to open the inline text editor
4. Type your note content
5. Click outside or press Enter to save

Your note appears as a colored text box on the script page, visible to anyone who can see the layer it belongs to.

## Editing a note

Double-click any text note to reopen the inline editor. You can change the text content and styling.

## Styling options

Notes support the following text styling:

- **Font family** — choose from available fonts
- **Font size** — adjust text size
- **Bold, italic, underline** — standard text formatting
- **Text color** — change the text color
- **Background color and opacity** — control the note's background appearance

!!! tip
    These styling options are configured per [layer](understanding-layers.md#layer-styling), so all notes on the same layer share a consistent look by default.

## Moving and resizing

- **Move** — Click and drag the note to reposition it
- **Resize** — Drag the corner handles to make the note larger or smaller. Notes have a minimum size to remain readable.

## Deleting a note

Select the note and click the red X button, or press Delete/Backspace while it's selected.

## Permissions

You can only edit or delete notes on layers you have edit access to. See [Understanding Layers](understanding-layers.md#permissions) for details.

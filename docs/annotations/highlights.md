# Highlights

Highlights are colored overlays you place on script pages to mark important areas. They're the most basic annotation type in ScriptMagic — use them to mark lines, flag sections, add text notes, or redact content.

## Creating a highlight

1. Make sure your desired [layer](understanding-layers.md) is selected as the active layer
2. Click and drag on the script page to draw a rectangular highlight
3. The highlight is created with the color and style of your active layer

## Highlight types

- **Basic** — A colored rectangle. The most common type for marking lines, sections, or areas of interest.
- **Text** — A highlight that contains editable text. Double-click to type inside it. See also [Notes](notes.md).
- **Blackout** — A solid black rectangle for redacting or covering content.
- **Whiteout** — A solid white rectangle with a light border for covering content.
- **DCA marker** — A circular numbered marker (1–16) used for sound cue assignments.

## Editing a highlight

- **Move** — Click and drag a highlight to reposition it
- **Resize** — Select a highlight, then drag the corner handles to resize
- **Edit text** — Double-click a text highlight to open the inline text editor
- **Edit properties** — Click the edit icon on a selected highlight to change its settings

## Text styling

Text highlights support:

- Font family and font size
- Bold, italic, and underline
- Text color
- Background color and opacity

!!! tip
    Text styling is configured per layer, so all highlights on the same layer share a consistent look by default. You can customize this in [layer styling](understanding-layers.md#layer-styling).

## Per-highlight format overrides

Individual highlights can override their layer's default styling. Click the format button on a selected highlight to open the format dialog, where you can adjust:

- **Color** and **opacity** — override the layer's highlight color
- **Border** — toggle a border and set its color and strength
- **Text color, font, and size** — for text highlights and cue text boxes
- **Bold, italic, underline** — text formatting overrides

Overridden properties are visually distinguished in the dialog. A badge shows the number of active overrides. You can reset individual properties or all overrides at once.

## Deleting a highlight

Select a highlight and click the red X button, or press Delete/Backspace while it's selected.

## Permissions

You can only edit or delete highlights on layers you have edit access to. Highlights on read-only layers can be viewed but not modified. See [Understanding Layers](understanding-layers.md#permissions) for details on layer permissions.

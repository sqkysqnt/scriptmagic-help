# Tags (Music, Video, Block)

Tags are a way to attach media and blocking references directly to script pages. Unlike [highlights](highlights.md) and [notes](notes.md), tags link to external content — audio tracks, video clips, and [blocking maps](../blocking/the-blocking-editor.md).

## Music tags

Music tags link audio files to specific pages in your script.

- **Appearance** — A dark badge with a gold border showing the track name and ID
- **Playback** — Click the play icon to listen to the audio. Only one track plays at a time.
- **Positioning** — Drag the tag to place it anywhere on the page
- **Creating** — Use the Music panel in the script view to add music tags

Music tags are useful for linking rehearsal tracks, underscoring, or sound effects to the relevant moments in the script.

## Video tags

Video tags link video files or URLs to script pages.

- **Appearance** — A dark badge with a video icon showing the title
- **Playback** — Click the tag to open the video in an external player
- **Positioning** — Drag the tag to place it on the page
- **Creating** — Use the Videos panel in the script view to add video tags

Video tags are useful for linking choreography references, staging videos, or design presentations.

## Blocking tags

Blocking tags display [blocking map](../blocking/the-blocking-editor.md) thumbnails on script pages, giving a quick visual reference for stage positions.

- **Appearance** — A thumbnail card showing a preview of the blocking map (see [Blocking Thumbnails](../blocking/blocking-thumbnails.md))
- **Preview** — Click the thumbnail to see the full-size blocking map
- **Editing** — Click "Edit" to open the blocking map in the [blocking editor](../blocking/the-blocking-editor.md)
- **Creating** — Use the Blocking panel in the script view, or create blocking maps from the blocking editor

## Common behavior

All tag types share these properties:

- **Layer assignment** — Tags are assigned to a [layer](understanding-layers.md) and follow that layer's visibility settings
- **Draggable** — Tags can be repositioned on the page by dragging
- **Lockable** — Tags can be locked in position to prevent accidental moves
- **Metadata** — Tags track who created them and when they were last modified

!!! note
    Each tag type has its own dedicated [system layer](understanding-layers.md#system-layers) (Music, Videos, Blocking) that is always at production visibility level.

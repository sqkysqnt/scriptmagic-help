# Inviting Team Members

Production admins can invite new people to join a production via email. This is the primary way to bring cast and crew into your ScriptMagic production.

## How to send an invitation

1. Open the [People management](../productions/people.md) screen for your production
2. Click **Invite**
3. Fill in the invitation form:
    - **Name** — the person's name (optional for bulk invites)
    - **Email(s)** — one or more email addresses, separated by commas
    - **Role** — choose Cast, Production Team, or Production Admin (see [Roles & Permissions](roles-and-permissions.md))
4. Send the invitation

## What happens next

**If the email belongs to an existing ScriptMagic user:**

- They're added to the production immediately
- The production appears on their dashboard
- You can optionally send them a welcome email

**If the email is new to ScriptMagic:**

- An invitation email is sent with a link to create an account and join the production
- The link expires after **7 days**
- When they click the link, they'll see a sign-up form with their email pre-filled (see [Creating an Account](../getting-started/creating-an-account.md))

## Checking invitation status

Invitations have three possible states:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Pending** | Sent but not yet accepted |
| **Accepted** | The person has joined |
| **Expired** | The 7-day window has passed without the link being used |

If an invitation expires, you can send a new one.

## Bulk invitations

Enter multiple email addresses separated by commas to invite several people at once. They'll all receive individual invitation emails and be assigned the same role.

!!! tip
    For even larger groups, you can also [import people from a CSV](../productions/people.md#import-from-csv) and then send invitations from the People management screen.

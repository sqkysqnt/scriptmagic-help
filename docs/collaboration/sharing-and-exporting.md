# Sharing & Exporting

ScriptMagic lets you export your annotated script as a PDF to share with others or print for rehearsals.

## Exporting a script

1. Open the export dialog from the script view
2. Configure your export settings:

**Layers:**

Choose which layers to include in the export. Only layers you have permission to view are available. Hidden layers are excluded by default.

**Page range:**

Export the entire script (default) or specify a custom page range.

**Annotations:**

The export includes all visible annotations from the selected layers:

- **Highlights** — colored overlays with their configured colors and opacity
- **Text notes** — text boxes with styling preserved
- **Cues** — moment markers and cue text boxes with connector lines (available to Production Team and Admin roles)

**Blocking maps:**

Choose how blocking maps are included in the export:

- **None** — no blocking content
- **Inline thumbnail** — small thumbnails drawn on script pages at their tag positions
- **Insert after page** — full blocking pages inserted after each script page that has blocking tags
- **All at end** — all blocking pages appended at the end of the export

3. Generate the export

## Sharing

After the PDF is generated:

- On **mobile** (iOS/Android), the system share sheet opens so you can send via email, messaging, AirDrop, or save to files
- On **desktop** (web, macOS, Windows, Linux), the PDF is saved to your downloads

ScriptMagic doesn't have built-in sharing links — you share the exported PDF through whatever channel works best for your team (email, cloud storage, messaging, etc.).

## What's included in the export

The exported PDF respects the same layer permissions as the in-app view:

- You'll only see layers your role has access to
- **Me** layers include only your own private annotations
- **Design** layers are only available to production team members
- **Production** layers are available to everyone

Cue author information (created by / modified by) can optionally be included in the export.

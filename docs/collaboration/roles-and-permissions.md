# Roles & Permissions

ScriptMagic uses a role-based system to control what each person can see and do within a production.

## Production roles

When someone joins a production, they're assigned one of three roles:

### Cast

The default role for performers and general participants.

- View scripts and navigate pages
- Create and edit personal annotation layers ("Me" visibility)
- View production-level layers shared by the team

### Production Team

For stage managers, designers, technicians, and other crew members.

- Everything Cast can do, plus:
- Create and edit **Production** and **Design** visibility layers
- View and edit cues
- Export scripts with annotations and cues
- View production team notes on structure items

### Production Admin

Full access to manage the production.

- Everything Production Team can do, plus:
- Edit production settings (name, dates, script, etc.)
- Manage people (add, remove, change roles)
- Manage characters and production structure
- Send invitations
- Delete the production

## Administrative roles

In addition to production roles, there are administrative roles that span across productions:

### Company Admin

Manages a specific company and all its productions.

- Create productions under their company
- Edit any production in their company
- Manage company-level people and settings
- Automatically added as a production admin on all company productions

### Site Admin

Full access to the entire ScriptMagic system.

- All Company Admin abilities
- Create and manage companies
- Access the admin dashboard
- Manage all users and global settings

## How roles are assigned

- **When invited**, the person sending the invitation chooses the role
- **After joining**, a production admin can change someone's role from the People management screen
- **Production-level overrides** — a person's role can be different in each production they belong to

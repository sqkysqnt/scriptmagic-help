# Company Management

A company in ScriptMagic represents your theatre company or production organization. Companies are the top-level grouping that holds productions and people together.

## What is a company?

Companies serve as the organizational layer above productions:

- A company can have **multiple productions**
- People added at the company level are **available across all of that company's productions**
- Company admins have management access to **all productions in their company**

## Company information

Each company stores:

- **Name**
- **Phone number**
- **Address**
- **Notes**
- **Admins** — one or more users designated as company administrators

## Creating a company

Company creation requires Site Admin permissions. To create a company:

1. Access the admin dashboard
2. Create a new company with a name, contact info, and at least one admin
3. The company is now available when creating new productions

## Company admins

Company admins can:

- Create and manage productions under their company
- Edit company information
- Manage company-level people
- They're automatically added as production admins on all productions within their company

A company can have multiple admins for redundancy and shared management.

## Company people

ScriptMagic uses a tiered data model for people:

1. **Company level** — Core contact information (name, email, phone, address, headshot) that's shared across all productions in the company
2. **Production level** — Production-specific information (audition notes, rehearsal conflicts, assigned characters) that's unique to each production

This means when someone works on multiple shows for the same company, you only need to maintain their contact details in one place.

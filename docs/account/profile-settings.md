# Profile Settings

Your profile stores your personal information and preferences in ScriptMagic. Access it from the **account menu** in the top-right corner of any screen, then click **Edit Profile**.

## What you can edit

**Basic information:**

- **Display name** — your name as shown throughout the app
- **Phone number**
- **Pronouns**

**Address:**

- Street address
- City
- State
- ZIP code

**Emergency contact:**

- Emergency contact name
- Emergency contact phone

**Additional:**

- **Notes / Accessibility / Medical info** — free text for any relevant information your production team should know
- **Profile photo** — upload a headshot that appears as your avatar throughout the app. This photo can also be used on [character stickers](../blocking/character-stickers.md) in blocking maps.

## Resetting your password

From the profile editor, click the **Reset Password** button. A password reset email will be sent to your account's email address. Follow the link in the email to set a new password.

## How profile updates sync

When you update your profile, production admins may see a notification on your record in their People management screen showing what changed. They can choose to accept the update or keep their existing information.
